put your writeups + drawings to the problems in a file titled YourName_DP_Writeup.pdf in this same directory
from your account, select "Create a pull request" where the base is this account's (CS-Queens-College-Yao) repository.
created a pull request from your fork to this original version, and then submit it via the Google form
1. Falling Glass

You are the designer and inventor of a shock-proof landing mat that could catch the fall of glass from a certain height. You want to guarantee that up to a certain number of floors, the glass will not break. You need to calculate that highest floor X where the glass will not break, but you only have a set amount of glass panes.

Notes:

A glass sheet that survives the fall can be used again in another trial.
The glass sheets are uniform, so results will not vary between them.
A shattered glass sheet has to be swept up and thrown away.
If glass shattered when it hits the mat, then it would shatter if dropped from a higher floor too.
If glass survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall.
There’s no guarantee that the glass falling from the first floor window will break, nor that the glass thrown from (last) nth-floor does not break.
If only one glass sheet is available and we want to be absolutely sure of getting the right result, we can only try from the first floor and move up one by one. In the worst case, we would try all the floors. But what if you had 2, or just some general m number of sheets?

Given: n floors, m glass sheets

Find: What’s the minimum amount of trials?

(The problem is not actually to find the critical floor, but just to decide floors from which glass sheets should be dropped so that total number of trials are minimized.)

(a) Describe the optimal substructure/recurrence that would lead to a recursive solution

(b) Draw recurrence tree for given (floors = 4, sheets = 2)

(c) Code your recursive solution under GlassFallingRecur(int n numFloors, int m numGlass)

(d) How many distinct subproblems do you end up with given 4 floors and 2 sheets?

(e) How many distinct subproblems for n floors and m sheets?

(f) Describe how you would memoize GlassFallingRecur

(g) Code a bottom-up solution GlassFallingBottomUp(int n numFloors, int m numGlass)

2. Rod cutting

Straightforward! I just want you to implement the Rod Cutting problem that is highlighted in the textbook as the first example in Chapter 15 Dynamic Programming. So first, read all about that problem in the textbook.

Example:

Given a rod length N and table of prices like so:

length | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

price | 1 5 8 9 10 17 17 20

Return: max value you could get for the rod pieces you cut up

(a) Draw the recursion tree for a rod of length 5

(Above is just an example, you could be given anything where length i = 1 to N and price is any integer)

(b) On page 370: answer 15.1-2 by coming up with a counterexample, meaning come up with a situation / some input that shows we can only try all the options via dynamic programming instead

of using a greedy choice.

(c) Code the memoized recursive version in RodCutting.java under rodCuttingRecur

(d) Code the bottom-up solution in RodCutting.java under rodCuttingBottomUp

Turn in: A pdf write-up of parts: a, b with clear and careful explanations! Coding parts c, d in the file RodCutting.java
